# My Recipe Planner

## About

This application allows the user to search for a meal based on their preference of meat and vegetable. The user may elect to generate a meal suggestion tailored to their input or generate a random suggestion if they prefer. Once an option is chosen, the user will be shown a meal along with its ingredients and how to prepare it. If the user is interested, they may find the nutrition facts about the meal, choose a random recipe, or return to the home screen to begin again.
